              Hi! I'm Leah and I am new to Web Developement. 
              I went to school for business and have been working in hospitality and sales within the craft beer industry for about 16 years now. During the pandemic I decided to take a chance and pursue UCSD Coding Camp in turn of a career change. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't wait for what this new adventure has in store for me!
            </p>
