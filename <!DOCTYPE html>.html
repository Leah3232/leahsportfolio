            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                 I have been working in hospitality for 15 years. I worked at Stone Brewing Company for about 14 years pouring beers and making peoples lives better!! During my career there, I worked as a sales rep for numerous wineries, another brewery and a distribution Company. I decided to take the path of web developement during the pandemic. I've always been interested in the industry. Coding and learning the languages of computers has always fascinated me and so...my journey begins!
